## ARTICLE IV - Organization of Officers and Election Procedures
### Section A. List of Officers by Title

Officers will be grouped into an entity called the “executive board”. Each member shall have his/her own title, but also be grouped together inside this entity. Positions offered are:
- President
- Treasurer
- Team Leader (x3) [Avionics, Structures, and Propulsion]

### Section B. Eligibility

Officers will be elected and selected based on a vote from the executive board following an interview process.  A majority of the board must decide that the candidate in the running should receive the position. This majority shall be defined as 50% of the group +1. No officer shall be elected with only 50% of the vote.

In the case of a vacancy, an interim officer will be designated by the executive board until a formal interview process may proceed. This interim officer must be eligible under article III, section A.

In the case that an officer is not doing his/her duties, he/she may be removed by a supermajority of all members of the organization. Should the executive board feel like an officer is not completing his/her tasks as the job role states, they may start a voting process to remove that officer. A supermajority of two thirds of all current, eligible members shall be required to remove the officer. Upon the removal of an officer, an interim officer will be elected until a formal interview process may proceed.

### Section C. Length of Officer Term

All elected officers shall be elected annually and serve a one-year term starting August 31st and ending the following August 24th, allowing for a 7 day transition of power. Appointed positions can start at any time and last a maximum of one year. 

### Section D. Election Procedure

Nominations for all elected officers will be collected starting August 20th. A list of nominees will be distributed to all current students one week before the interview process begins. All nominees will undergo an interview process between August 20th and August 24th. The executive board will make final decisions on the officers on August 24th and begin the transition of power phase. The executive board must vote on the officers before they can take power. The vote must contain 50% +1 person to be a valid election. Candidates receiving the majority vote must accept the position, orally or written, before he/she assumes office.

#### Section D.1. Unfair Vote Removal

If the general members of the organization find that the decision of the executive board is unfair or biased, they may call a vote to replace the officer in question. A member must contact the President and call for an unfair vote removal. In such a case, a vote will be called one week following the request for removal including all other candidates applicable for the position. The general members will then vote on the candidates. A simple majority of 50% +1 is required to vote a member into the office in question. Candidates receiving the majority vote must accept the position, orally or written, before he/she assumes office.

### Section D. Officer Removal

Any member may call for an executive board vote to remove an officer by submitting a written request to the President. If the President is the officer in question, the request is to be submitted to the Advisor. The President/Advisor will send a letter discussing the matter to the  officer in question. Referral one will not result in an executive board vote, but will allow the board to take action if they see fit. (For example, inappropriate conduct  could be met with an immediate vote, while lack of work may not. Only the most serious of offenses may be met with a vote after one referral).

If a second request for removal is made, the officer in question will be given the opportunity to meet with executive board to argue their case. The executive board will then conduct a vote after the meeting to decide the solution to the issue. If the board has a supermajority of two thirds voting for removal, the officer in question will be removed and an interim officer will take the position until a formal interview process can occur.

If a three or more requests for removal are made, a vote including all members of the organization  will occur. If 50% +1 of the group votes in favor of removal, the officer in question will be removed and an interim officer will take the position until a formal interview process can occur.

### Section D. Election Procedure

In the event of an elected position vacancy, the executive board will vote on an interim officer until a formal interview process can occur. The interim officer may be elected to the position, but will be removed from the officer’s position when the board votes on the interviewed candidates. Such a vote will require 50% +1 of the board to be in favor of addition of the officer and will require the individual in question to accept the position, orally or written, before he/she assumes office.

## ARTICLE V - Advisor

During the dissolution period, an official meeting shall be called (following all previously stated clauses) to vote for the funds’ final destinations. Upon the finalization of the vote, the unspent funds are to be disseminated accordingly, and the group is to adjourn for the final time.
